# Weather Dashboard

ReactNative Developer Test
## Instruction

Using the OpenWeatherMap API [Open Weather Map API](http://www.openweathermap.com/current), build a Weather Dashboard App using ReactNative.

The App should have two pages:

- The “Home” page, displaying the list of the user’s weather widgets.

    Each widget displays the name of the city, the current temperature in Celsius and an icon of the weather [weather-icons](http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)

- The “Settings” page, used to edit the content of the “Home” page.

    The user can Add, Remove weather widgets.

You are free to increase the features and create the design.
